// Closure - Only happens with an anonymous function, for example  

// When the element is created the function would remember the input that was provided just for the this particular instance

// const nums = [101.103,105,107]
// const funcs = []; 
// for (let n of numbers){
//     funcs.push(function(){
        // the value of n must be a local scope variable
//         console.log(n); 
//     })
// }
// funcs[1](); 

// it closes on the value n and this has to be a local scope variable. 


// Refractoring - to take code that is already working and tiding it up
// Programming is getting the code to work 
// Software engining is setting the structure of the code and organising the files that you hav 

// The bind pop up can return a string / HTML / function
